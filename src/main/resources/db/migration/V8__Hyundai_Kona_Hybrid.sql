'The Kona Hybrid is really only the version that you should look at if you’re a company car chooser who’s not quite ready to commit to full electric. Its official CO2 emissions are low, to help with BIK rates, while its practicality remains so-so, its scores in these areas are, in truth, in the same ballpark as those of one of its main rivals, the Toyota C-HR. But it’s hard to look past the fact that the 1.0-litre version of Hyundai’s small SUV will get pretty close to the Hybrid’s efficiency in real-world use - as well as being considerably cheaper and no worse to drive.',
