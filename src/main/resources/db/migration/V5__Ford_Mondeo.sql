'The Ford Mondeo - now in its fourth generation - is the largest and priciest it has ever been, although the family car is also a more premium, refined and high-tech offering than it was before. It faces fierce competition from the likes of the Skoda Superb, Mazda 6 and VW Passat, but its core strengths ensure that it holds its own.',
