"If you're one of those people who catches themselves muttering about cars looking the same these days, you clearly haven't studied the Honda Civic very closely.We would argue it looks like no other car that's ever existed, let alone any other current family car. Whether you approve of its looks or not is another question entirely, and it's not one for us to answer here. After all, we're in the business of dealing with the objective facts, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.",
