'The Ford Kuga not only belongs to the super-fashionable large SUV car class, but also covers pretty much all bases by including hybrid and plug-in hybrid power choices in its line-up. On one hand, the Kuga keys into our appetite for zero-emissions motoring, with a PHEV version that gives you a good electric-only range between charges. On the other, company car drivers will enjoy the financial benefits of low CO2 emissions when it comes to paying their benefit-in-kind tax bills. Then there are full and mild hybrids (the FHEV and MHEV) to suit those who are unlikely to be able to plug their car in at home, plus traditional petrol and diesel engines. In other words, there’s a Kuga SUV for most family trips – from popping to the shops to towing a caravan from one end of the country to the other.',
