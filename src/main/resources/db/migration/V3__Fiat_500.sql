'If it’s retro charm you’re after, not many new cars come close to the chic Fiat 500. With looks harking back to the Fifties classic of the same name, this reimagining of the 500 (Cinquecento in Italy) turns heads like few other cars in its price bracket. So, what are the electric Fiat 500’s key rivals? Well, the Smart EQ Fortwo is definitely one, but the baby Fiat also has to hold its own against larger alternatives  including the Honda E, Mini Electric, Peugeot e-208 and Renault Zoe. To help it compete, it has a relatively long official range of up to 199 miles, and when it’s out of juice it can charge up more quickly than many of its competitors.',
